# Analyzing Liberia’s Demographic Data

# 1.	Introduction
When creating policies and establishing resources to address education deficits in a population, policymakers must not only know what the education levels of said population are, but also why those education levels are what they are. There are numerous factors that can influence an individual’s level of education, including their location, size, wealth, gender, and age. In the event that Liberian policymakers want to change the overall education levels of their country, they must first recognize the underlying factors that may be contributing to low education levels while also understanding what factors promote higher education levels. In order to better understand this along with numerous other demographic information, the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services released the 2013 Liberia Demographic and Health Survey. For our research purposes, we will focus on a subset of data released as a result of this survey. This subset of data contains 48,219 data points from individuals. For each individual, there are several independent variables— location, size, wealth, gender, and age. There is also the dependent variable— education.
# 2. Summary Statistics
Number of Observations = 48,219

The average level of education of an individual in Liberia is 0.6653. The average size is 6.9345. The average wealth is 2.4319. The average age is 22.4990.

There are two genders in the data set. There is a slight majority in Gender 1. There are 15 localities in the data set. The location with the most data points is location 11 with 13.20% of the individuals from there.

The average education level for a person of gender 1 is 0.8153. The average education level for a person of gender 2 is 0.5118.

Compared to the average education associated with the complete set of data, the average for individuals with above average (>2.4319) wealth is higher (31.87% increase). There is also more variation in the education levels of the above average wealth subset than there is for the total education level. The average education for the top wealth tier (where wealth is equal to 5) is also significantly higher than the total education average (90.21% increase). In this subset, the data continues to become even more varied than both the original set of data and the above average wealth subset. The average education level for individuals with below average wealth is less than the all data average with a 23.84% decrease. This subset also appears to have the least variation of any of the other education subsets.
