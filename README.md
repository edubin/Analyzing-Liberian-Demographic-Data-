# Analyzing Liberia’s Demographic Data
Emma Dubin
# 1.	Introduction
When creating policies and establishing resources to address education deficits in a population, policymakers must not only know what the education levels of said population are, but also why those education levels are what they are. There are numerous factors that can influence an individual’s level of education, including their location, size, wealth, gender, and age. In the event that Liberian policymakers want to change the overall education levels of their country, they must first recognize the underlying factors that may be contributing to low education levels while also understanding what factors promote higher education levels. In order to better understand this along with numerous other demographic information, the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services released the 2013 Liberia Demographic and Health Survey. For our research purposes, we will focus on a subset of data released as a result of this survey. This subset of data contains 48,219 data points from individuals. For each individual, there are several independent variables— location, size, wealth, gender, and age. There is also the dependent variable— education.
# 2. Summary Statistics
